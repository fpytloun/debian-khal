Submitting a Bug
================

If you found a bug or any part of khal isn't working as you
expected, please check if that bug is not already reported at

https://github.com/geier/khal/issues?state=open

and open a new issue otherwise.

Please run the command again with the -v option enabled and paste
the output of that (of course you can edit out any private
details).

Getting Involved in Development
===============================

Tests for khal are in the `test` subdirectory and are supposed to be run
with py.test (``py.test tests``).

Please feel free to send pull requests very early, or even open an issue
before writing any code if you are not entirely sure about your
approach. Also please ask for help if you are stuck somehow.
