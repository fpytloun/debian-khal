-
-You might want to head over to the tutorial_ on how to setup *vdirsyncer*.
-Afterwards you will need to re-setup your *khal* configuration (copy the new

-CHANGELOG
----------
-* new unified documentation
-    * html documentation (website) and man pages are all generated from the same
-      sources via sphinx (type `make html` or `make man` in doc/, the result
-      will be build in *build/html* or *build/man* respectively (also available
-      on `Read the Docs`__)
-    * the new documentation lives in doc/
-    * the package sphinxcontrib-newsfeed is needed for generating the html
-      version (for generating an RSS feed)
-    * the man pages live doc/build/man/, they can be build by running
-      `make man` in doc/sphinx/
-* new dependencies: configobj, tzlocal>=1.0
-* **IMPORTANT**: the configuration file's syntax changed (again), have a look at the new
-  documentation for details
-* local_timezone and default_timezone will now be set to the timezone the
-  computer is set to (if they are not set in the configuration file)
